# Template Theme for Oqtane

This is a template theme for [Oqtane](https://www.oqtane.org/). The idea is that you...

1. Download it and build it to verify it works
1. Then replace all the names / IDs etc. so it matches what you want to publish
1. And then you can start customizing as you want to 


## What's included / What features does this have?

1. A Standard Visual Studio Solution with 1 Project containing the Theme
1. The Theme is named `Template` from company `Example` making it easy to replace text fragments
1. 1 Theme with Code-Behind
1. 2 Layouts - Single Pane and Multi-Pane
1. 2 Containers - Default and No-Title
1. Minimal code/namespaces, so renaming the folder will automatically rename the namespace of your theme
1. It builds into a DLL and has various automations to auto-push to your Dev-Oqtane environment incl. assets in a `dist` folder
1. A separate `Theme Src` project containing TypeScript which is compiled into the theme
1. Checklists for all modifications you need


## What is still WIP

1. package.json and bootstrap 4 SASS automation
1. Typescripts / JavaScripts to include
